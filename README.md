Game Background:  
  
In this game, there is an elevator with no upper limit on floor levels that keeps moving upward. Player is one of the passengers in this elevator and player needs to eat and fart as the elevator moves up. Of course, other passengers, the NPCs, in this elevator will be mad at player farting. Player's goal is to reach high floor level while eating and farting in the elevator, and try not to let NPCs get super angry before they get off the elevator.  


Player Controll:  
  
Press and hold [Space] to fart.

Player has to eat food in the food bar located on the right hand side of the screen. If the food bar is full(more than 6 foods are generated), GAME OVER!  
After player eats food, player gain a certain amount of fart and cause the fart to have different attributes(stinky and/or loud). Player has to fart to reduce the amount of fart. If the player is full of fart, GAME OVER!  
As player farts, other passengers on the elevator(NPCs) will get mad. However, some of them are wearing a headphone so they CANNOT hear loud farts, and some of them are wearing a mask so they CANNOT smell stinky farts! If the anger of any of the NPCs are full(they are really angry), GAME OVER!
